Historify
========

Map based web application that allows you to document the transformation of a city using text, pictures, audio and video.

The app is built using HTML5 and Django, and currently supports the  map of Doha, Qatar.

The application features a time line that allows you to go "back in time" and click on different parts of the map to see what the area looked like in that year. You can navigate through media for a particular area using page flips.

Adding media to the application is simple - simply navigate to a date using the timeline, and drag'n'drop the media to the area you want your media to be associated with.

Localization is also supported in this application, and currently the application can be localized for English and Azeri language speakers.
